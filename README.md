# ğŸ’¬ ABOUT ME

### âš¡ I am a junior Front - end developer. I strive to gain as much practical experience as possible in real projects, so, I am focused on active and productive work.

### ğŸ¤© I'm a fast learner and interested in getting more.And most importantly, I have a burning desire to learn everything.

### ğŸ’» In the future I want to become a Full-Stack developer, and I am currently actively studying Spring and React. And I want to start my journey with a React in Front, but I don't mind trying myself in the Backend.
